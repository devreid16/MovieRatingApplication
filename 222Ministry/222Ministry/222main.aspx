           <h3><img src="num1.png" alt="1." /> Following Jesus' Command to Make Disciples</h3>

           <p>
               Matthew 28:19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in
               the name of the Father and the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to
               obey everything I have commanded you.
           </p>

           <p>
               2 Timothy 2:2 And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many
               witnesses entrust to reliable men who will also be qualified to teach others.
           </p>

        <h3><img src="num2.png" alt="2." />Reproducing Disciples</h3>

        <p>Not only are we to teach others the Faith (Evangelism), we also are to teach them how to teach it to others.
           Paul exhorts Timothy to practice this in his letter (2 Tim 2:2).</p><p> Though Jesus preached the Christian Gospel to the crowds,  
           His plan for reaching the whole world was to do so through his disciples (Mat. 28:19-20).<p> He invested intensely in them, 
           especially Peter, James, and John.  Then He sent them out to make disciples of all nations.</p>
