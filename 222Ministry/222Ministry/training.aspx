      <h4>Training Materials</h4>
      <p>
        This four-step discipleship process (25 lessons total) begins with the basics and equips people for a life-time of ministry. Those who go through the process are equipped to disciple someone else. The four steps are shown here along with some lesson titles from each step:  </p>

          <h4>How Does Destined Series Work? </h4> 
      <p>We come to your church to present the material.  After which we will train a program leader.  After completion of the training the disciple will be equipped to train others.  Then the others will further train more.  </p>
<p>This is a very flexible program; typically it is a two year process to complete.  Some one2one partners have taken longer and some shorter.  It depends on the relationship and the in-depth discussions.  You set your own pace. </p>
<p>There are no specific time or place to meet.  Typically one2one meet weekly, though some do bi-weekly.   The one2one partners determine the meeting place.  Some have met at churches, homes, restaurants and even in cars.  It is whatever is comfortable for the partners. </P>
<p> Once you reach book three is usually the time to look for another partner to start the discipleship, however  there is nothing to restrict from doing earlier </p>
